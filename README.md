# Dynamic Block Allocation (DBA) algorithm

Dynamic Block Allocation Algorithm [Double Brute Force (DBFA) and Multi Brute Force (MBFA)]

Dynamic Block Allocation algorithm (DBA) represents a new and flexible method (2013) for partitioning string sequences into data blocks taking into account different rules imposed by a function. Two versions of this algorithm are presented, namely DBFA (Double Brute Force Algorithm) and MBFA (Multi Brute Force Algorithm). These algorithms are originally written in Visual Basic 6.0. The ZIP package (below) contains four applications. These applications cover both the experiments performed with this algorithm and a small implementation.
